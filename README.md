# Stitching-Images

## Overview

This project involves image processing and computer vision techniques to detect features, match points between image pairs, and create panoramas using the following methods:

FAST (Features from Accelerated Segment Test) feature detection
Robust FAST using Harris Cornerness metric
Point description and matching
RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) for robust matching
Image stitching to create panoramas
